A text-rendered, faux gui for terminal

This program is to be designed to give a text rendered gui environ to the user. It is aimed at someone, for instance who is using a Raspberry Pi.

Fun expected soon.

A massive thank you to the people at Stack Overflow, especially phihag who showed me how to query the systems devices (for the initial screen resolution commands)
